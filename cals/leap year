If any number is divisible by 400 or (4 and should not divisible by 100), then it is called leap year.




import java.util.*;
  class Ctof{
    public static void main(String args[]){
      Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
      int n=s.nextInt();
      if(n%400==0 || n%4==0 && n%100!=0) System.out.println(n+" is leap year.");
      else System.out.println(n+" is not a leap year.");
      
    }
  }
